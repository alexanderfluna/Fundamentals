Integral(uv') = uv - integral(u'v)

1. Regular integration by parts.

2. Integration by parts where v' = 1. Use this for taking the integral of ln(x).

3. If the function has e^x, sin(x), or cos(x) and a polynomial, use the table method. This is where you keep doing integration by parts until the derivative of the polynomial reaches 0.

4. If the function has e^x, sin(x), or cos(x) together, do integration by parts twice until you get the origninal integrand you are solving for. Then add the integrand to both sides to get the answer.
